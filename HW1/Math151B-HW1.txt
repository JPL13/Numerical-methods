C2:
	The steady state value of the solution for r=2 is 0.99978
	The steady state value of the solution for r=0.5 is 0.99540
	
C3:     For h=0.1, the solution is 0.85426
	For h=0.05, the solution is 0.85653
	For h=0.025, the solution is 0.85754
	The rate of convergence is 1.16834
	
C4:
	For h=0.25, the solution approaches to steady state
	For h=0.5, the solution oscillates around 1 and does not approach to a steady state.   
	For h=0.75, the solution oscillates even more and does not approach to a steady state.   
	The solutions computed with the larger time step do not indicate the actual behavior of populations. With large time steps, the error accumulated and the estimation diverged from the actual function value.
