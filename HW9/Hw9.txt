(a)
Maximal degree :9

Condition # of A  =      6.39018e+08
Condition # of AtA =     4.08181e+17

(b)
The maximal degree is the same when a different random seed is used

(c)
The direct solution of the normal equations with degree of 10 results in the smallest residual of both the linear system of equations and the fit.

[C2]
(a)
The expected value of coefficient of Ï•n(x) is 1.
The expected size of the residual is 0.

(b)
The direct method : degree 6.

Condition # of AtA =    1.90006e+13
Condition # of A  =     4.35897e+06


The QR method: degree 11.

Condition # of A  =    3.01130e+13
Condition # of AtA =   9.35013e+21

(c)
The direct method at degree 6:
The residual:              5.147741725044980e-09
Error in the coefficient:  2.910383045673370e-11

The QR method at degree 11:
The residual:              1.758411200138879e-14
Error in the coefficient:  2.008615496151833e-12

For direct method, the residual is approximately 100 times bigger than the error in the coefficient.

For the QR method, the residual is approximately 100 times smaller than the error in the coefficient.

We can approximately infer the size of the coefficient error from the size of the residual s using the above relationships.
