(b)
Timestep size required to achieve qualitative agreement with the fully converged solution :51

(c) Estimate of the maximal value of df/dy :

df/dy is in the range (-20, 9.7)

if df/dy<0, maximal value is 20

if df/dy>0, maximal value is 9.7

(d) Yes. My observed tilmestep in (a) is 60. It coincide with the estimate of the tilmestep obtained from the estimate in (c) and a consideration of the interval of absolute stability for the 2nd order Runge-Kutta method
